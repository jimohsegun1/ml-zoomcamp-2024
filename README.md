# Machine Learning Zoomcamp Course

Each Jupyter notebook within this repository attempts to explore a specific machine-learning algorithm and some useful tools required for data scientists. I try to balance practical implementations with the underlying mathematical foundations of these models on my notes based on the homeworks proposed by the course [Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://datatalks.club/courses/2021-winter-ml-zoomcamp.html). I alo use as a guide the book  [Machine Learning Bookcamp](https://mlbookcamp.com/), while the mathematical insights are drawn from the book [Data Mining and Machine Learning](https://dataminingbook.info/)


While this repository reflects my personal journey of learning and understanding machine learning, I hope it can also be a valuable resource for others on a similar path.

## [Chapter 1: Intro](https://github.com/jimohsegun1/ml-zoomcamp-2024/tree/main/01-Intro)
Introduction **Introduction**.

## [Chapter 2: Machine Learning for Regression](https://github.com/jimohsegun1/ml-zoomcamp-2024/tree/main/02-regression)
How to create a car-price prediction project with a **linear regression** model.

## [Chapter 3: Machine Learning for Classification](https://github.com/jimohsegun1/ml-zoomcamp-2024/tree/main/03-classification)
Predicting customers who will churn with **logistic regression** for classification.

## [Chapter 4: Evaluation Metrics for Classification](https://github.com/jimohsegun1/ml-zoomcamp-2024/tree/main/04-evaluation)
Study of **confusion matrix**, deriving metrics from confusion matrices, like precision and recall, and Using **ROC and AUC metrics** to further understand the performance of a binary classification. We also focus on Tuning the parameters for the model and how to use cross-validation to verify the model's behavior.

## [Chapter 5: Deploying Machine Learning Models](https://github.com/jimohsegun1/ml-zoomcamp-2024/tree/main/05-deployment)
Introduction on how to save models with Pickle and Flask, how to manage dependencies with Pipenv, and how to use Docker.

## [Chapter 6: Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning](https://github.com/jimohsegun1/ml-zoomcamp-2024/tree/main/06-trees)
Project for predicting the risk of default with tree-based models (**Decision tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost**).

## [Chapter 7: Midterm Project](https://github.com/jimohsegun1/ml-zoomcamp-2024/tree/main/07-mid-term-project)
The used dataset is from Kaggle. The csv file is quite small so I put it in the Data folder. It is a Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset for heart attack classification. The dataset has 14 columns and we can use the "output" column as our target variable. This column devide the patients in patients with less chance of heart attack (output = 0) and patients with more chance of heart attack (output = 1).

## [Chapter 8: Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/jimohsegun1/ml-zoomcamp-2024/tree/main/08-Neural-networks-and-deep-learning)
Study about the fundamentals and applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a class of deep neural networks, primarily used to analyze images.

## [Chapter 9: Serverless Deep Learning](https://github.com/jimohsegun1/ml-zoomcamp-2024/tree/main/09-serverless%20deep%20learning)
Deploying deep learning models in a serverless environment, showing the benefits of scalability, cost-efficiency, and ease of deployment.

## [Chapter 10: Kubernetes]()
Study about Kubernetes, an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. 

<!-- ## [Chapter 11: Final Project]()
In this project, was build a machine learning model to predict the trip duration of taxi rides in New York City. The dataset is from Kaggle. The original dataset have approximately 1.4 million entries for the training set and 630k for the test set, although only the training set is used in this project. -->
